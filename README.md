An Exploratory Data Analysis on a global terrorism dataset is found in this repository
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a method for better understanding your data and assisting in subsequent data preprocessing. It is the critical process of conducting preliminary data investigations to discover patterns, identify anomalies, test hypotheses, and validate assumptions using summary statistics and graphical representations. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a step in the Data Analysis Process that employs a variety of techniques to better understand the dataset under consideration. Exploratory Data Analysis accomplishes two major tasks:

This project extracts, cleans, analysis and visualizes the dataset of global terrorism.
